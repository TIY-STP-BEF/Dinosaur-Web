### Success!

The API that you built yesterday impressed the local museum and they wants you to build a website, for their museum, that uses your API. So for today's project, build a website that uses your API to manage your dinosaur data.

### Level 1 (basic CRUD) 
Create a website that manages the dinosaurs:

#### Requirements
- Displays all the dinosaurs in the API that only shows the name and a picture of that dinosaur ( HINT: you will have to imageUrl to a dinosaur)
- When a user clicks on a dinosaur, you are taken to a Dinosaur page that displays all the information for that dinosaurs
- Add page to create dinosaurs
- On that dinosaur's page, there should be an `edit` button and a `delete` button
- the delete button should delete the dinosaur from the API and then redirect to the homepage
- the edit button should allow the user to edit the dinorsaur


#### HINTS: 
- this should be in the same node project.
- this will use DOM more manipulation and less mustache than other back end projects
- feel free to have fun with the design
- feel free to add columns that support a musuem exhibit 
- this may feel like a lot, but focus on requirement at a time and try to reuse the client javascript as much as possible. 


### Level 2 (features for customers)
Create a couple of webpage and features for the museum goers to view and learn about dinosaurs

#### Requirements
- Add a new display all dinosaurs page that shows all the dinosaurs in a mobile friendly UI. 
- Allow the musuem goer to view more data about the dinosaur but not have them edit the information or delete the information
- Add a search to the API and a allow a museum goer to search for a dinosaur

#### HINTS:
- Remember that the same template can be used for different routes
- Do not worry about authentication 
- Have fun with the mobile friendly design
- Some of these requirements are purposefully a little vague to practice working with real-world requirements, ask questions if you are lost.
